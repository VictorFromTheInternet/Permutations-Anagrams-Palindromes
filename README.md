# Permutations-Anagrams-Palindromes
## Summary
This program is a combination of a three basic string processing problems: ***Palindromes***, ***Permutations***, and ***Anagrams***.
- ***Palindromes***: 
    - A word that can be spelled forwards and backwards the same (Ex: Racecar, Rotor)
- ***Anagrams***:
    - Two or more words that contain the same letters but can be rearranged to spell each other (Ex: Earth, Heart, Hater)
- ***Permutations***:
    - All possible rearrangements of letters in a word (Ex: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA)
         

## Procedure
Upon execution the program will ask the user to input a one word string into the console, it will then ...
- test if the input is a palindrome
- output all permutations for the input, 
- search for anagrams from a .txt


The data file that will be used in this program contains ~45,000 words and will be processed into a ***Hash-Table*** for easy look up when searching for ***Anagrams***.
